<title>Identifiers should not be composed of 'l' and 'O' characters only</title>

<description>
<p>The characters 'l' (which is lowercase 'L') and 'O' (which is uppercase 'o') should not be the only characters used in the identifier, because this would make them visually similar to numeric literals.</p>
